# 🔥 Classification of Fire Types in India Using MODIS Satellite Data
This project involves the classification of fire events across India using MODIS satellite data for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook and aims to study wildfire patterns, types, and trends using geospatial and temporal data.

## 📌 Objective
The main goals of this project are:

-To analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of fire incidents in India.

-To classify fire types based on satellite-observed parameters (e.g., FRP, Brightness).

-To identify trends and hotspots of fire activities over time.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

=Python

=Jupyter Notebook

-Pandas

-NumPy

-Matplotlib / Seaborn

-Scikit-learn

-Geopandas (optional for mapping)

## 📊 Data Sources
Data is obtained from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite datasets:

-Fire data for India (2021, 2022, 2023) in CSV format.

Run the cells in order to:

Load the dataset

-Perform EDA (exploratory data analysis)

-Train a classifier (if applicable)

-Visualize trends and fire types

## 📈 Sample Output
-Charts showing monthly and yearly fire frequency.

-Maps of fire locations (if plotted).

-Classification of fire types based on rules or ML models.

## ✅ Future Improvements
-Add machine learning models for more accurate classification.

-Integrate GIS mapping.

-Automate the report generation.
